"A lifesaver! OK, OK... Maybe a slight exaggeration, but if I'm going to be on lock down for 3 weeks I need comfort food to get me through it. The Gelato places near me were either closed (which I actually do get) or in the case of one shortened their hours (again is fine) but closed even earlier for no reason. I was having a serious craving by that point so on the hunt for good Gelato I went. I called ahead and the nice woman assured me she was open until 9. I pulled up a little after 8 and was greeted by a super sweet woman. Under the restrictions of everything she was complying with keeping distance and keeping everything sanitized. I was so happy to walk out with 2 pints of wonderfully delicious Gelato (in some of the most unique flavors I've had), at a much better price than everyone else, and while all of this uncertainty goes on around me. I can now happily self-quarantine for 3 weeks with some Tiramisu, Birthday Cake, Bavarian Mint, and Coppa Mista by my side.
